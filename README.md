# A microcontroller "Hello, World!" with LCD
This repository corresponds to my blog post on how to write "Hello, World!" to an LCD using a microcontroller. I used [cortex-m-quickstart](https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m-quickstart) as the template for this project. I developed this for the STM32F303DISCOVERY board, so if you are running this on a different board, you will probably need to make changes to the `memory.x` file.
