# A microcontroller "Hello, World!" with LCD
This repository corresponds to my [blog post](https://badboi.dev/rust,/microcontrollers/2020/11/09/i2c-hello-world.html) on how to write "Hello, World!" to an LCD using a microcontroller. I used the [cortex-m-quickstart](https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m-quickstart) repository as the template for this project. I developed this for the STM32F303DISCOVERY board, so if you are running this on a different board, you will probably need to make changes to the `memory.x` file.
